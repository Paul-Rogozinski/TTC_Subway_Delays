Each station has its own indicator to indicate whether there is any alert posted.
There will be one of two indicators shown on the subway map screen depending on its state.
A white ring indicator present over the station indicates there is no alert posted at that specific station.
Clicking a white ring indicator brings the user to a new screen where they can post an alert for that station.
A red indicator with a white exclamation mark present over the station indicates there is an alert posted at that specific station.
Clicking a red alert indicator brings the user to a new screen where alert details are displayed for that station.
By default all stations will display a white ring indicator, however the indicator will change to red with a white exclamation mark once an alert has been posted by a user.
